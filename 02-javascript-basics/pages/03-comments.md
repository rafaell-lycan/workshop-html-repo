# Step 3: Comments

Sometimes you might want to make a note for yourself in your code. Comments can be helpful for remembering logic and terminology, and make your code easier to understand for other people.

### Try it out

To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes `//` in front of the code or text. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.

For example, here's a comment on the line above some code:

```js
// checking type of hello world
console.log(typeof 'Hello world!');
```

You can even put comments on the same line as actual code:

```js
console.log(typeof 'Hello world!'); // checking type of hello world
```

To create a comment block in JavaScfript, you will use the same example that we have in CSS by putting everything on the following expression `/* your comment here */`. All the content between this expression will be ignored.

An example:

```js
var data = 'Hello world!';
/*
Unecessary code that now is commented
data = true;
*/
console.log(typeof datatype);
```

### Mini challenge

Add some helpful comments to the code you wrote in the last step. Run the code and make sure you haven't broken anything!
